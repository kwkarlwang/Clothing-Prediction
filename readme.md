# Clothing Fit Prediction

This project is a data science project that uses customers' reviews to predict the fit of clothings. This project is conducted by [Karl Wang](http://github.com/kwkarlwang) and [Chenfeng Wu](https://github.com/chenfengw).

The dataset is about reviews from Rent-The-Runway and can be found [here](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#clothing_fit)

Rent-The-Runway is a company that offers rental service to woman clothing. We use the review text as our main features to predict whether the customer thinks the rented clothing is small, fit, or large.

In this project, we focus on text analysis and we experiment with different text feature representations, such as 
n-gram and term frequency-inverse document frequency. We compare models, such as Naive Bayes and SVM, to find the model best suitted for text classification.
